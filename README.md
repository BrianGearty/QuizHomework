 This Music Trivia application is fired off by clicking a "Start" button that initiates a countdown timer and displays the first question. When the first question is displayed the user will have 3 choices to choose from.
 Once a choice is taken the user will be brought to the next question so on and so forth until all the questions have been answered and or the timer runs out. If a user chooses a wrong answer 10 seconds will be taken off of 
 the countdown timer. If the user does not complete all of the questions before the time runs out the page will clear and they will need to restart. If the user completes all of the questions they will be propmpted to add
